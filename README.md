# ELPIS (w.i.p.)

**FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**

## What does this do?

If you can access this repo, you likely already have some idea.

## So what's the deal with the name?

The name comes from the first song I tested this with, [ΕΛΠΙΣ (pronounced "elpis") by dj TAKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DItVx94YIG0).

## How do I run this?

Since this is now a library it's not meant to be "run" anymore.

## What's happening now?

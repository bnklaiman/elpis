# ELPIS (w.i.p.)

**FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**

## What does this do?

This is a library that can take `.1` level files and `.2dx` or `.s3p` audio container files from Konami's rhythm game "beatmania IIDX" (pronounced "two-dee-ecks"), and converts them into the open `.bmson` and `.ogg` level and audio formats, respectively.

## That's a strange name, why is it called that?

The name comes from the first song I tested this with, [ΕΛΠΙΣ (pronounced "elpis") by dj TAKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DItVx94YIG0). Also, both the name and song itself sound cool, so that's a plus.

## How do I run this?

Since this a library this is not meant to be "run". Due to the necessary use of closed-source files, this project is purely for educational purposes only.
